        body: "<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This game was made for the Game Maker ToolKit Game Jam in 2017, the topic was multiple uses of a single game element/mechanic. In this game you as need to put on a puppet show, performing actions to tell the story of a brave pirate. The audience will react to you actions and if they are happy, you win.
