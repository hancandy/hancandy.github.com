        body: "<p><span>HangoVR is a fast-paced&nbsp;2 players collaborative party game in VR</span>. The game is made during&nbsp;Nordic Game Jam 2017. It is design with a strong social aspect in mind, where we explored the possibility of multiplayer game play in VR.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>So you wake up at your friend&#39;s place after a crazy party, and it&#39;s a MESS. It&#39;s already afternoon, your friend&#39;s parents are coming home in a few minutes.</p>\n\n<p>Both of you have to work together to fix the place. Players at the PC will look at photos of the room and assist the player in VR to place items in the right place, or to throw them out the window.</p>\n\n<p><span>Role: Game designer, 3D artist, project management</span></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://rugerfred.itch.io/hangovr\">itch.io link</a></p>\n"

        heading: 'Dead Water'
        body: "<p>Dead Water is made in my first year of study at ITU. It is a<span>&nbsp;fish tank horror game where you &nbsp;play as a fish in a tank where the filter in blocked. The water becomes murky and you need to solve puzzles to make the filter run again while avoiding enemy fish.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span>The concept was inspired from my experience having a fish tank. I realised that fish, although quite harmless looking, are actually very brutal. Countless time i wake up and find a clean eaten set of skeleton or fish swimming with half its body gone. My idea was it is actually rather scary if you have limited space to move in, where it is dark and murky and you can barely know where the enemies are .</span></p>\n\n<p><span>Role: Game designer, 3D artist, animator, project management</span></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://kimberlyliu.itch.io/dead-water\">itch.io link</a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n"
