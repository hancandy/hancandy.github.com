        body: "<p><span>HangoVR is a fast-paced&nbsp;2 players collaborative party game in VR. It</span>&nbsp;is the first Virtual Realtity (VR) game that I participated in. The game is made for Nordic Game Jam 2017. It is design with a strong social aspect in mind, where we explored the possibility of multiplayer game play in VR.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>So you wake up at your friend&#39;s place after a crazy party, and it&#39;s a MESS. It&#39;s already afternoon, your friend&#39;s parents are coming home in a few minutes.</p>\n\n<p>Both of you have to work together to fix the place. Players at the PC will look at photos of the room and assist the player in VR to place items in the right place, or to throw them out the window.</p>\n"
