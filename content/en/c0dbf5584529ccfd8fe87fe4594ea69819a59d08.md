        heading: 'Dead Water'
        body: "<p>Dead Water is made in my first year of study at ITU. It is a<span>&nbsp;fish tank horror game where you &nbsp;play as a fish in a tank where the filter in blocked. The water becomes murky and you need to solve puzzles to make the filter run again while avoiding enemy fish.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p><span>I came up with the concept from my experience in owning a fish tank.I realised that fish, although quite harmless looking, are actually very brutal. Countless time i wake up and find a clean eaten set of skeleton or fish swimming with half its body gone. My idea was it is actually rather scary if you have limited space to move in, where it is dark and murky and you can barely know where the enemies are .</span></p>\n\n<p><span>Role: Game designer, 3D artist, animator, project management</span></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://kimberlyliu.itch.io/dead-water\">itch.io link</a></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n"

        heading: 'Stop Playing'
        body: "<p>Stop Playing is a first person puzzle PC game where you manipulate your environment to proceed. The concept comes to the thought of making gameplay out of using a game engine, but in a simple, visual way.
